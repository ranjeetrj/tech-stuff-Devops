The Terraform files you provided are used to create a basic VPC infrastructure with two public subnets and two private subnets. The public subnets have a NAT gateway attached to them, and the private subnets have a security group rule that allows SSH traffic from the bastion host. The bastion host is in a public subnet and has a security group rule that allows SSH traffic from the public IP address of your computer.

The Terraform files also create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) that is attached to the two private subnets. The NLB has a listener that listens on port 80 and forwards traffic to a target group. The target group has the two private instances attached to it.

Overall, the Terraform files you provided create a secure and scalable VPC infrastructure that you can use to host your web applications.
